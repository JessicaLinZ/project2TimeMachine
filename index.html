        <p class="info">The persistence of vision is an optical phenomenon where visual stimuli briefly lingers in our vision despite having already disappeared from view.
            <br><br>In film and animation, this effect can be used to trick the eye into seeing moving images. Because it is believed that the human eye struggles to differentiate between more than 12 frames
            in a single second, animators take advantage of this to adjust the fluidity of motion by animating on either 1s or 2s in a 24fps sequence. Anything fewer than 12fps can potentially disrupt the effect and appear jittery.
            On the other hand, using 24 separate images in a 24fps sequence matches the framerate of live-action film and comes across as believable to the human eye.
            <br><br> Try scrolling on this page at different speeds to see what lingers in your vision (frame dropping aside).
